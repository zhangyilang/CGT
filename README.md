# Compressed Group Testing (CGT) algorithm

This repository provides code for Compressed Group Testing (CGT) algorithm. The corresponding paper is 'Compressed group test of Coronavirus with expedited RNA detection in large sample mixtures'.

## Note
All the codes run successfully on matlab R2019a. It is unclear whether earlier versions of maltab are supported.

## Demos

To obtain the performance on SNR, run **SIM_CGT_SNR.m**.

To obtain the performance on infection rate, run **SIM_CGT_infection_rate.m**.

To obtain the performance on compression ratio, run **SIM_CGT_compression_ratio.m**.

The specific parameters are remarked in each file in detail. You can also freely modify the parameters to review the performance of the CGT algorithm in different settings.
